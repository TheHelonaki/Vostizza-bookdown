# Population of Venetian Vostizza {#population}

TODO: revise and expand text

The Athenians were not the only people who emigrated to the Morea during the Venetian occupation. When the Venetians began taking stock of their new territory, they found that it was severely depopulated and underutilized. To solve these problems, the Venetians brought settlers from the northern coast of the Corinthian Gulf, Chios, and the Ionian islands into the Peloponnese. Among the newcomers to the Morea were 636 families from Salona who settled in the Vostizza region.45 The overall program of resettlement was successful and the population of the Morea rose from a 1692 calculation of 116,000 to over 250,000 by 1708.46
