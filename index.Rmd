*Venetian Vostizza* is an examination of the Second Period of Venetian Domination
(1685 - 1715) in the territory of Vostizza in the northern Peloponnesus of Greece. This project began as my M.A. thesis (Classics - 2005) at the University of Cincinnati, which was suggested by my advisor. Since then, I have revisited the material in a multivariate statistics course, where I analyzed the villas using contingency analysis, and in various presentations.

My analysis of Venetian Vostizza is unpublished except for the M.A. thesis [TODO - add citation]. This project is intended both to examine the cadastral data using new methods for analysis and visualization and to expand knowledge of this period. My training since my M.A. has been in Geography and it is with a geographic framework that I reexamine Venetian Vostizza. In particular, I bring a view that humans and the environment are intertwined and that each must be examined in light of the other.

The current form of this reanalysis of Venetian Vostizza as a bookdown web book with embedded leaflet.js maps was inspired by On The Line [TODO - add ref; https://ontheline.trincoll.edu/], which helpfully includes how to create a similar project in Chapter 9 Mapping and Publishing *On The Line*. Before finding this resource, I had been struggling with how to include all the analyses I envision for Venetian Vostizza onto a single web map. Now I can include useful maps as part of a larger narrative within a chapter and the book itself.

Up to this point, Venetian Vostizza has been a solo project, but I welcome collaboration. In the near future, I will make the cadastral database available as an API and make the geojson files available via Github. If you use the data and would like to contribute a chapter about your analysis, please contact me so we can collaborate.

Less formally, please add annotations and comments to *Venetian Vostizza* using hypothes.is [TODO - add link; https://web.hypothes.is/]. To start using hypothes.is, go to the hypothes.is website and click Get Started. Then follow the steps of 1) creating a free account, 2) adding the Chrome extension or bookmarklet to your browser, and 3) annotating.

This project is still in its infancy. One of the issues I had grappled with is that I do not yet know the best way to tell the story of Venetian Vostizza. In this phase, I will make the chapters of my M.A. thesis available here (please forgive the pie charts), as well as new writing, maps, and analysis of the topics I feel are most important: 1) how the cadastral records were collected; 2) how does the 2nd Period of Venetian Rule fit into the overall history of the region; 3) what were the patterns of population, including depopulation and immigration, during the 2nd Period of Venetian Rule; 4) what was the economy of Vostizza like before, during, and after the 2nd Period of Venetian Rule; 5) how much did the landscape and environment affect population and economic trends in Venetian Vostizza; and 6) what was the built environment like in Venetian Vostizza. These topics are subject to change as analysis and maps are created and written about.

In the next phase of this work, I anticipate a reorganization of the topics to create a narrative for Venetian Vostizza.
