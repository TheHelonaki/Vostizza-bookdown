Grimani b.81/17-3] Thirty-five villas were listed with their resources. Potamia di Calavrita, which belonged to the territory of Calavrita to the south of Vostizza, was also included in the catastico ordinario, so only 34 of the villas pertain to Vostizza. The records in the catastico ordinario include a short description of where the villa was located, followed by the amounts of cultivable and uncultivable land. The numbers of churches, houses, olive presses, felt mills, springs, and mills were given, followed by the number of plants, including olive and mulberry trees, and animals. Finally the number of families and religious personnel living in the villa were listed.

Grimani b.81/56-279.] Only the 34 villas that were part of the territory of Vostizza are included in the catastico particolare. The catastico particolare includes all of the information in the catastico ordinario for each villa. The catastico particolare also includes a listing of each piece of property in the villa and a map or maps that show the location of each piece of property.
