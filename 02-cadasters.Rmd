# Venetian Cadasters for Vostizza {#cadasters}

**TODO: revise and expand text**

In order to identify which land was deserted and also to create a system of taxation based on ownership of land, the Venetians immediately began a program of land-survey in 1687. Three directors were appointed to take charge of the survey of the Morea (sindici e catasticatori): Marin Michiel, Gierolimo Renier, and Domenico Gritti.^[@toppingCoexistenceGreeksLatins1976, p. 310; @toppingPREMODERNPELOPONNESUSLAND1976, pp. 92-93. Renier died during the first year of work, leaving the burden of the land survey to fall upon Michiel and Gritti. The more detailed Catastico Particolare for Vostizza was accomplished by Francesco Grimani.] The catastico ordinario, an account of each settlement in a territory, was completed for almost the entire Peloponnese by Michiel and Gritti. The catastico particolare, a listing of plots of land in each luogo, was only completed for the territories of Elis, Fanari, Karitaina, Argos, Vostizza, and Romania.^[@toppingPREMODERNPELOPONNESUSLAND1976, p. 96. The cadaster for Nauplion is discussed in @liataNayplioKaiEndohora2002.] The two land-surveys of Vostizza were submitted to the Venetian Senate in 1700.


## Villa Maps

The Venetians were thorough in their recording of property in Vostizza. Each field in a luogo was recorded on a map of the luogo that was included with the lists of property included in the catastico particolare. The boundary of each field on the map was then traced in color, in order to indicate the type of land ownership (i.e., beneprobatum, non- beneprobatum, concession, and ecclesiastical land) and an identification number was assigned to it. A number on each field on the map corresponds to the entry for the field in the catastico particolare (Fig. 26).
Surveying property boundaries had been a well-practiced art among the Venetians for well over 100 years when they conquered the Morea. In the terraferma, surveyors had been creating maps that displayed property boundaries since the 16th century, usually in reference to irrigation projects.115 Cartographers such as Giacomo Gastaldo and Cristoforo Sorte served then as surveyors in the terraferma. Their work included the determination of field size and the rendering of their shape on maps, activities which were also used in the construction of the catastico particolare of Vostizza.116 By 1564, Venetian maps recorded property boundaries, such as in Fig. 27. The work of surveying fields in Vostizza would have been routine for Venetian surveyors.
