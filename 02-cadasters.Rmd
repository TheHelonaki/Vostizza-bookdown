# Venetian Cadasters for Vostizza {#cadasters}

**TODO: revise and expand text**

In order to identify which land was deserted and also to create a system of taxation based on ownership of land, the Venetians immediately began a program of land-survey in 1687. Three directors were appointed to take charge of the survey of the Morea (sindici e catasticatori): Marin Michiel, Gierolimo Renier, and Domenico Gritti.^[@toppingCoexistenceGreeksLatins1976, p. 310; @toppingPREMODERNPELOPONNESUSLAND1976, pp. 92-93. Renier died during the first year of work, leaving the burden of the land survey to fall upon Michiel and Gritti. The more detailed Catastico Particolare for Vostizza was accomplished by Francesco Grimani.] The catastico ordinario, an account of each settlement in a territory, was completed for almost the entire Peloponnese by Michiel and Gritti. The catastico particolare, a listing of plots of land in each luogo, was only completed for the territories of Elis, Fanari, Karitaina, Argos, Vostizza, and Romania.^[@toppingPREMODERNPELOPONNESUSLAND1976, p. 96. The cadaster for Nauplion is discussed in @liataNayplioKaiEndohora2002.] The two land-surveys of Vostizza were submitted to the Venetian Senate in 1700.
