# Venetian Vostizza (1685-1715) {#venetian}

### Administrative Units in Vostizza
The basic administrative units of the Morea under Venetian control were provinces, territories, luoghi, and settlements. The Morea was divided into four provinces, each of which had a capital â€“ Romania, Messenia, Achaia, and Laconia (Fig. 17). Each province was further divided into territories. The territory of Vostizza was in the province of Achaia, along with the territories of Calavrita, Gastugni, and Patrasso. In each territory were luoghi87 that contained one or more settlements, the latter being the smallest form of residential organization recorded. The organization of these administrative units was not fixed immediately after the conquest of the Morea, but was still in flux in 1700, as is discussed below.
